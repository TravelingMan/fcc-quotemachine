# fcc-quotemachine
Free Code Camp assignment to build a simple random quote machine.

## User Stories (the objectives)
* I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

1. The API in use is allowed to generate explicit content.
2. The Twitter link is only logging to the debug console to avoid
spamming Twitter.
